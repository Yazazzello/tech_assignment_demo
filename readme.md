Technical Assignment from mobile company one for choice.

1. Connect to the foursquare API and retrieve the 10 nearest restaurants to your current location, displaying them in a map and in a list

2. Country Finder
Build an app that, based on a geolocation, tells the user in which country the location lies. The app has to work without Internet access. It has to show a map of the world, with some way of specifying a location. It has to show the country code or name of the country at that location. Try to optimize the app for speed (users do not like waiting) and keep an eye on memory usage (users do not like crashing apps). Your code should contain comments to clarify anything that you think needs clarification. Also, if you can, provide a written overview of your app and analysis of the problem and the software design decisions you made.
To help you get started, we provide a .kml Google Earth overlay file containing the geometry information of all the countries in the world. Your app should use this information to determine in which country a given geocoordinate is situated.

3. As a user a would like to see in an app and on a map my location in realtime and also the milemarker (https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hito_kilom%C3%A9trico) which are placed along the road.
